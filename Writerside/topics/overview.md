# Overview

Welcome to Infuzu, your partner in Intelligent Model Selection (IMS). Infuzu's IMS platform helps developers seamlessly 
interact with a variety of Large Language Models (LLMs), intelligently selecting the most suitable LLM for each request. 
This means you can focus on building great applications without worrying about which LLM to pick.

IMS is designed to help you:
- **Automatically choose the best LLM**: Instead of hard-coding your LLM choice, let IMS pick the model that's best suited 
for your input and constraints.
- **Integrate easily**: Just make a simple API call with a standardized request body.
- **Scale effortlessly**: As your usage and needs grow, Infuzu grows with you, ensuring the right model and optimal 
performance.

This documentation will guide you through the setup, usage, pricing and error handling of the IMS API so you can get 
started quickly and confidently.
